# PastebinCrawlerLib
A library for web crawling http://pastebin.com

## Is this legal?
According to pastebin's offical website it is. 
See http://pastebin.com/faq#17
```
I got blocked! Can I scrape your website?

Yes, but we do limit the amount of requests that people can make, 
so it is very possible that you get blocked from time to time. 
If you want to scrape our platform more intensely, 
we have a custom scraper API available where we can whitelist your IP, so you don't get blocked anymore. 
This feature is only available for LIFETIME PRO users. To learn more, visit our scraping page.

See its FAQ section http://pastebin.com/faq for more information.
